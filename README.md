Nexus Encryption
================

Enterprise‚Äëgrade, desktop‚Äëfirst encryption app built with Next.js 15 + React 19 (frontend) and Tauri (Rust) for a hardened native experience. Designed for modern teams that care about cryptography, DX, and ship‚Äëready automation.

Quick start
-----------

```bash
# Install deps
pnpm install

# Run web UI for the Tauri shell to load (port 3020)
PORT=3020 pnpm dev

# In a second terminal, launch the desktop app
pnpm tauri dev

# Build signed desktop bundles (configure signing for macOS/Windows first)
pnpm tauri build
```

Why this exists (and what you get)
----------------------------------

- Strong, modern crypto primitives: **AES‚Äë256‚ÄëGCM**, ChaCha20‚ÄëPoly1305 (via AES‚ÄëGCM simulation), **PBKDF2** key derivation, **CSPRNG** via `crypto.getRandomValues()`.
- Desktop‚Äënative security with **Tauri**: small footprint, Rust backend, **OS keychain** integration for secrets.
- Defense‚Äëin‚Äëdepth: strict CSP, HSTS, COOP/COEP/CORP, X‚ÄëFrame‚ÄëOptions, Permissions‚ÄëPolicy, input validation/sanitization, centralized error handling, rate limiting.
- Thorough tests: unit, component, performance, chaos, and stress tests (Vitest + JSDOM + workers) with clear reports.
- Operational polish: CI/CD for releases, SBOM + OSV scanning, PWA manifest, SEO, docs, and deploy scripts.

Architecture at a glance
------------------------

See the full docs site with diagrams at `docs/` or online (build with `pnpm -C docs build && pnpm -C docs serve`).

How encryption works (high level)
---------------------------------

1. A key is derived from a passphrase using **PBKDF2** (configurable iterations/salt).
2. A random **IV** (12 bytes) is generated via CSPRNG.
3. Plaintext is encrypted with **AES‚Äë256‚ÄëGCM** to produce `ciphertext + auth tag`.
4. Result is encoded (base64) alongside IV and algorithm metadata.
5. On decrypt, the same derivation + AES‚ÄëGCM verifies the tag; tampering fails safely.

Key features by module
----------------------

- `lib/crypto-utils.ts`: crypto primitives (AES‚ÄëGCM, PBKDF2, RNG, key strength analysis, helpers).
- `lib/secure-store.ts`: seamless storage using Tauri keychain when available, localStorage fallback in web.
- `lib/input-validator.ts`: comprehensive validation and sanitization for user inputs and filenames.
- `lib/error-handler.ts`: central error capture, severity levels, structured logs.
- `lib/security-auditor.ts`: automated configuration checks and a summarized report.
- `lib/rate-limiter.ts`: in‚Äëmemory limiter with cleanup to throttle abusive actions.
- `components/nexus-cipher.tsx`: primary UI including the Key Generator tab.
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`: Rust commands (`keychain_set/get/delete`) and app bootstrapping.

Detailed architecture
---------------------

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for diagrams (component, sequence, and data‚Äëflow), threat model, error strategy, and performance notes.

Local development
-----------------

```bash
pnpm install
PORT=3020 pnpm dev          # Next.js dev server for the UI
pnpm tauri dev              # Tauri shell running the desktop app
```

Testing & quality
-----------------

```bash
pnpm test:all          # run unit, component, performance, chaos, stress
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:component
pnpm test:performance
pnpm test:security
pnpm typecheck
```

Notes:
- Stress tests that simulate extremely heavy crypto workloads may be constrained by JSDOM; real desktop runs are faster and more reliable.
- Coverage is configured via Vitest; see `TESTING.md` for structure and results.

Security hardening
------------------

- Strong CSP, HSTS, frame/embedding protections, COOP/COEP/CORP, Permissions‚ÄëPolicy.
- Input validation and sanitization across UI entry points.
- Centralized error handling with categorized severity and structured logging.
- Rate limiting for expensive or potentially exploitable operations.
- Tauri keychain for secrets (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, etc.).
- SBOM generation + OSV vulnerability scanning in CI.

CI/CD & releases
----------------

- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml` (builds, SBOM, OSV scan, Tauri release).
- Configure secrets for macOS notarization/signing and Windows signing as needed.
- Tauri‚Äôs updater is wired; generate your private key and store it securely; publish the public key.

Deployment
----------

- Desktop: `pnpm tauri build` creates platform installers in `src-tauri/target/`.
- Web preview/PWA: Next.js build output; see `DEPLOYMENT.md` for Docker and hosting details.

Project layout (selected)
-------------------------

```

src-tauri/            # Rust backend + Tauri configuration

```

Compliance & docs

- `PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

Troubleshooting
---------------

- If Tauri cannot find the UI dev server, ensure you used `PORT=3020 pnpm dev` and that `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` points to that port.
- If unit tests fail due to environment APIs, confirm `test-setup.ts` is loaded and mocks are applied (see `vitest.config.mjs`).

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep security discussions focused and actionable. For high‚Äërisk findings, disclose privately first.

Final note
----------

This app is intentionally both practical and paranoid: human‚Äëfriendly UX on the surface, obsessive cryptographic hygiene underneath. Encrypt boldly.
